This directory is intentionally left empty (except this readme file).
It exists to pass the test for a $SHARE_DIR/restore/$BACKUP directory
in prep/default/035_valid_backup_methods.sh because the mkopalpba workflow
abuses the (nonexistent) BACKUP method OPALPBA to create a PBA image,
cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2351
